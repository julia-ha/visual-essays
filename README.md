## Domestication of Maize
Maize domestication Ann Arbor is one of the greatest feats of artificial selection and evolution, wherein a weedy plant in Central Mexico was converted through human-mediated selection into the most productive crop in the world.

So large, in fact, that we may be more familiar with sunflower imagery than with the actual flower. Its proliferation in European art since the late sixteenth century was due partly to the aesthetic appeal of traits artificially selected to increase seed production—a single composite flower head with a large disk—and partly to the timing of its introduction to Europe just prior to the blossoming of a new genre of botanical treatise, called the [florilegium](https://wordsmith.org/words/florilegium.html) (collection of flowers), in the early 1600s. The transplanting of the flower and the cultural excitement surrounding its foreign provenance were also fueled by the European exploration and colonization of North America prior to and during this period.

The tree has many uses that intersect with daily life including as a source of food, medicine, insect repellant, bedding, fuel, and protection. The bark can be easily peeled from the tree has been used for shelter construction, fuelwood, wrapping food, lining earth ovens, bundling babies, and as a bandage with antiseptic properties. Additionally, the trees have environmental benefits including soil conservation, windbreaking, and erosion control.

_Girl with a Pearl Earring_ (Dutch: Meisje met de parel) is an oil painting by Dutch Golden Age painter Johannes Vermeer, 
dated c. 1665. Going by various names over the centuries, it became known by its present title towards the end of the 
20th century after the earring worn by the girl portrayed there.[^1]

The tamarind tree is a non-endangered semi-evergreen fast-growing species. It is best suited to those regions characterized by seasonal dry forests, tropical seasonal forests, and savanna biomes.[^ref6] These biomes’ climates feature slightly strong thermal oscillation and concentrated rains during specific parts of the year, resulting in water stress for plants during the dry season. Tamarind, therefore, is a drought-resistant tree with the capacity to grow in poorly developed soils through nitrogen fixation, a feature shared by all species from the Fabaceae family. In addition, it can endure aerosol salt from windy coastal areas and sequesters carbon. For these reasons, it’s not surprising that tamarind can be found in fifty-four countries along the plant’s historical circulation routes, starting in Acapulco, where it is believed to have been first planted by the Spanish. In the Sahelian region and many other parts of Africa, tamarind fruits collected from ‘natural’ populations or individual trees are essential components of the non-monetized ‘hidden harvest’ of wild resources. The assessment of the economic importance of the tamarind fruits’ “hidden harvest” requires estimating how much local populations would have to pay to replace these ‘free’ resources.[^ref7] As such, tamarind acts as an enhancer of agroforestry for small farmers and landless laborers in semi-arid areas in danger of desertification.

The Grasse-based [Chiris perfumerie,](https://monumentum.fr/anciennes-parfumeries-chiris-pa00080934.html) founded by Antoine Chiris in 1768, provides a case study on the production of pelargonium oils.[^ref32] The artisanal factory specialized in manufacturing soaps, ointments, scented waters, and perfumes from aromatic plants. In the nineteenth century, Chiris expanded into a global, industrial company with many farms in colonized territories. For example, it used colonial labor to grow “Rose geranium” or _Pelargonium graveolens_ in Boufarik, Algeria. In 1865, the company built a cutting-edge 3,000 square meter factory in Boufarik’s Saint-Marguerite domain, growing pelargoniums along with orange and eucalyptus trees.[^ref33] The group of photographs, shows the Chiris complex and its workers engaging in cultivating, harvesting, and preparing pelargoniums for making rose-scented oils and other products.

Maize’s cultural, political, and economic significance persists in Central American communities today. Milpa agriculture continues to be practiced by Maya farmers and has been hailed as “[central](https://allianceforscience.cornell.edu/blog/2017/10/a-mexican-legacy-la-milpa-the-birthplace-of-maize/#:~:text=The%20importance%20of%20the%20milpa,an%20amazing%20variety%20of%20peppers.)” in the preservation of the biodiversity of Mexico. However, this is not to say that the symbiotic relationship between Indigenous communities and the plant has remained unchanged— anthropologists have noted the effects of globalization and migration patterns. As one woman named Teresa living in San Miguel del Valle, Oaxaca puts it: “No, we didn't have to go looking for maize [like we do now]...That’s how we lived, that’s how it was before. Now it is different. Why? Because we live in the town... and we no longer have everything that we produced naturally, not anymore. What we eat now comes from elsewhere.”[^ref33] Beverages like atole, which used to be produced domestically, have been industrialized, and are now sold by multinational companies.

While the domesticated sunflower is an imposing presence in nature, its aesthetic portrayals also hold powerful and enduring visual appeal. Like the supersized flower in this [botanical illustration,](https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/1/collection/924404/common-sunflower-and-greyhound) cultivated _Helianthus annuus_ looms large in many cultural imaginaries. So large, in fact, that we may be more familiar with sunflower imagery than with the actual flower. Its proliferation in European art since the late sixteenth century was due partly to the aesthetic appeal of traits artificially selected to increase seed production—a single composite flower head with a large disk—and partly to the timing of its introduction to Europe just prior to the blossoming of a new genre of botanical treatise, called the [florilegium](https://wordsmith.org/words/florilegium.html) (collection of flowers), in the early 1600s.
