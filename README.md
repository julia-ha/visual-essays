dated c. 1665. Going by various names over the centuries, it became known by its present title towards the end of the 
20th century after the earring worn by the girl portrayed there.[^1]

The migration of sunflower iconography from one source to another is evidenced in the pages of Francisco Hernández’s [_Nova plantarum_,](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/54114015) published posthumously in 1651.[^ref10] The book purports to document plants and animals that the naturalist and physician and his team, which included several Indigenous artists, observed during a three-year expedition through New Spain (present-day Mexico) in the 1570s.[^ref11] However, its illustrations of sunflowers, shown here, were not drawn on site from local flora but rather borrowed from European models. The <span data-click-image-zoomto="1|-45,1,912,758">upper illustration</span> was adapted directly or through intermediary sources from Besler’s _Flos Solis maior_.
