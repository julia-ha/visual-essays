       description=“There was no flower on earth that Charles Dickens loved quite as much as the scarlet “geranium.” However, the scarlet “geranium” with which Dickens was so enamored and that remains so beloved today is actually an altogether different plant—the pelargonium. Confused with the geranium since its introduction into Europe in the early 1600s, the pelargonium has a remarkable yet lesser-known history all its own. By telling the story of the Pelargonium as an entity separate from the Geranium, this visual narrative highlights the Pelargonium’s unique morphology and nomenclature as well as its far-reaching impact in the spheres of industry, technology, agriculture, culture, and society.”>

### What’s in a Name?

There was no flower on earth that Charles Dickens loved quite as much as the scarlet “geranium.”[^ref1] With its vibrant red blooms and showy foliage, this cheerful plant always adorned the dining table and dominated the garden in “a blaze of color” at his country home [Gad’s Hill Place,](https://thegardenstrust.blog/2020/01/25/dickens-and-gardens/) in Kent.[^ref2] Attendees at his public readings could always count on seeing the scarlet flower displayed in his jacket buttonhole, and his appreciation of the flower was such that his daughter, Mamie Dickens, recalls her sister saying to him, “I believe, papa, that when you become an angel your wings will be made of looking-glass and your crown of scarlet geraniums.”[^ref3]
